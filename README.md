Amethyst is a next-generation core plugin, designed to give your server everything it needs to get started. It's 
designed to be highly modular and modern, supporting RGB from day one.

## Building

Build the parent project with Maven as standard:

`mvn clean package`

## Contributing

The project is still very early in development, and for this reason we kindly ask that you hold off from
contributing any code without speaking to us first in our Discord server <https://support.lucyy.me>.
