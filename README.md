# WaterCore

Heavily WIP, does not work yet.

Build with maven, standard `mvn clean package`. Depend on `me.lucyy:watercore-api` for modules, provided scope. Public repository coming Soonâ„¢.

### Code style

Code style is based on Google, with some tweaks:
- Removed import order checks (static should come after non-static)
- Tab indentation instead of spaces
- Line length increased to 124
- Removed some javadoc-related checks
